In the second semester of my Android programming course, I enrolled in the "PGR208 Android Programming" exam, held in Autumn 2023. This comprehensive exam tested our ability to develop a full-fledged mobile application using Kotlin and Android Studio.

Practical Information:

The exam could be attempted individually or in groups of up to three students.
We were required to submit the project in a zipped folder through the WISEFlow exam system.
Interaction with teachers and TAs was permitted for guidance, but they wouldn't provide direct solutions.
For groups, additional functionality beyond the minimum requirements was expected.
Report/Documentation:

A detailed report between 500 - 1500 words, describing our implementation choices and processes, was part of the submission.
This report served as a means to explain our decision-making process, challenges faced, and the aspects of the project we were most proud of.
Submission Format:

The submission included the source code, the report, and any other relevant documentation, all compressed into a .zip file.
Project Case:

The task was to develop a prototype mobile application for a startup specializing in design products, using the Fake Store API.
The app was designed to offer an intuitive experience from browsing products to checking out and viewing past orders.
App Requirements:

The app comprised several screens, each with its minimum requirements and suggested additional functionalities.
Screen #1 - Product Overview: Displayed all available products with options to navigate to other screens. Additional features could include product filtering and offline browsing.
Screen #2 - Product Details: Offered detailed information about selected products with an option to add them to the cart.
Screen #3 - Shopping Cart: Showcased items added to the cart, with functionalities to remove items or adjust their quantities.
Screen #4 - Order History: Listed past orders with an option for detailed views.
Expected Functionality/Techniques:

The primary language for development was Kotlin, and Android Studio was used as the IDE.
The app interacted with the FakeStoreAPI to fetch product data.
Local storage was used for cart and order history data.
The app was designed to handle configuration changes like device rotation effectively.
Navigation between screens and data passing was a crucial part of the functionality.
Evaluation/Assessment:

The evaluation was based on various aspects such as code structure, UI/UX, local storage implementation, API interaction, and the quality of the report/documentation.
This exam not only tested our technical skills in Android development but also our ability to document and justify our design and development choices, fostering a comprehensive understanding of mobile application development.
